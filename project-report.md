## Abstract
In todayâ€™s world, wildfires have become one of the most serious natural calamities affecting millions of people worldwide every year. The ability to predict these disasters would not only help in curbing the impact but also give us a chance to improvise the prediction techniques. In this project, we will be aiming to analyze the data using Apache Spark and scikit-learn library on US wildfires applying different techniques on the dataset and predicting the outcome such as classifying the regions from most affected to the least affected. Secondly in determining how predictable the wildfires are concerning factors such as size and location, also visualization of the data and the factors impacting the outcome to understand the behavior of these natural occurrences. By implementing this project we hope to learn the process of using Big Data and Machine learning techniques.
 
## 1. INTRODUCTION
## a. Context ##
Our project deals with the ability to predict the occurrence of wildfires based on its asscociated attributes. The data that we will be using has been provided by the US Government. The wildfire records were acquired from the reporting systems of federal, state, and local fire organizations, the core data elements of the records being discovery date, final fire size, and a point location. Data transformation has been applied so that it conforms to the data standards of the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG). Basic error-checking was performed to remove redundant records. The filtered data set  includes 1.88 million geo-referenced wildfire records, representing a total of 140 million acres burned during the 24-year period.

## b. Objectives ##
 * Prediction of wildfire size based on its attributes.
 * To identify what regions are the most and least prone to wildfires by using clustering.
 * Given the size, location and date, predicting the cause of a fire wildfire.
 * Ability to predict the containment time for a wildfire.
